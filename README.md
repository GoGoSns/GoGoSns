## Who is GoGo 
I'm GÃ¶kmen
I've been deeply involved in crypto technologies since 2016, and I follow the developments in this field with a passion, almost like breathing. I strive to learn everything about new trends and innovations. Throughout this journey, I've been part of various communities and took on roles as a community manager. What excites me the most is my passion for decentralized systems and the advancement of blockchain technologies. That's why, even without incentives most of the time, I participate in various mainnets and testnets, aiming to contribute to their development.
